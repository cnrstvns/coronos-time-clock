# Coronos
## A New Timecard Management Solution

### What is it?
Coronos is a Java-based timecard program which allows for wage management.


### Why Coronos?
Coronos' features allow it to easily fetch and calculate wages. It also has a big clock so that's pretty nice. And jokes. And it has a chat, so you can ~waste time on the job~ talk with tech support if you need help.
